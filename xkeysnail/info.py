__doc__ = """
``xkeysnail`` is yet another keyboard remapping tool for X environment.
It's like ``xmodmap`` but allows more flexible remappings.

-  Has high-level and flexible remapping mechanisms, such as

   -  **per-application keybindings can be defined**
   -  **multiple stroke keybindings can be defined** such as
      ``Ctrl+x Ctrl+c`` to ``Ctrl+q``
   -  **not only key remapping but arbitrary commands defined by
      Python can be bound to a key**

-  Runs in low-level layer (``evdev`` and ``uinput``), making
   **remapping work in almost all the places**
